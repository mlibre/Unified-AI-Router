# Unified AI Router Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Lightweight Architecture
Node.js applications MUST remain lightweight and high-performance. Dependencies MUST be minimal and purposeful.

### II. OpenAI-Compatibility
Project must have OpenAI compatibility endpoints for seamless integration. Endpoints MUST support both streaming and non-streaming responses.

### III. Multi-Provider Fallback Reliability
Automatic fallback MUST be implemented for provider failures. Circuit breaker patterns MUST be applied to prevent cascading failures.

### IV. Simple and Clear Code
Code MUST be simple, clear, and readable. Complex solutions MUST be avoided in favor of straightforward, maintainable code.

### V. Developer-Centric Documentation
All documentation MUST be developer-focused with clear technical explanations. Quickstart guides MUST enable developers to run locally within 5 minutes.

## Development Workflow

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to API compatibility or core architecture
- MINOR: New providers, features, or non-breaking enhancements
- PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation updates, performance improvements
