# Core Rules

The following principles and rules **MUST** always be followed, under all circumstances:

## I. Lightweight Architecture

Code, logic, and architecture **MUST** remain lightweight. Dependencies **MUST** be minimal and purposeful.

## II. Simple and Minimalist Implementation

Code **MUST** be simple, clear, and readable. Prefer straightforward, maintainable solutions over complex ones.  
Keep the codebase minimal: avoid clever or tricky one-liners in favor of clarity.
Keep the codebase clean: avoid code duplication.

## III. Developer-Centric Documentation

All documentation **MUST** be developer-focused, with clear, concise technical explanations. Quickstart guides **MUST** enable local setup in under 5 minutes.

## IV. Change Management

If changes are made, update `package.json` and documentation (Markdown files) to reflect them.

## V. Comprehensive Change Analysis

When implementing or fixing code, always verify correctness by analyzing related files and dependencies.
