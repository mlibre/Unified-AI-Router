# Core Principles

The following principles MUST be followed when working with this project:

## I. Lightweight Architecture

Code, logic, and architecture MUST remain lightweight. Dependencies MUST be minimal and purposeful.

## II. Simple and Minimalist Implementation

Code MUST be simple, clear, and readable. Prefer straightforward, maintainable solutions over complex ones.  
Keep the codebase minimal: avoid clever or tricky one-liners in favor of clarity.

## III. Developer-Centric Documentation

All documentation MUST be developer-focused, with clear, concise technical explanations. Quickstart guides MUST enable local setup in under 5 minutes.

## IV. Change Management

If you made changes, update `package.json` and documentation (markdown files) to reflect them.

## V. Comprehensive Change Analysis

When implementing or fixing code, always verify changes are correct by analyzing related files and dependencies.
