# Core Principles

## I. Lightweight Architecture

Code, logic, and architecture MUST remain lightweight. Dependencies MUST be minimal and purposeful.

## II. Simple and Minimalist Implementation

Code MUST be simple, clear, and readable. Prefer straightforward, maintainable solutions over complex ones.  
Keep the codebase minimal: avoid clever or tricky one-liners in favor of clarity.

## III. Developer-Centric Documentation

All documentation MUST be developer-focused, with clear, concise technical explanations. Quickstart guides MUST enable local setup in under 5 minutes.

# Other Notes

If you make changes, update `package.json` to reflect them.
