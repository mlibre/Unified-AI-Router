# Core Rules

The following principles and rules **MUST** always be followed, under all circumstances:

## I. Lightweight Architecture

Code, logic, and architecture **MUST** remain lightweight. Dependencies **MUST** be minimal and purposeful.

## II. Simple and Minimalist Implementation

Code **MUST** be simple, clear, and readable—prefer straightforward, maintainable solutions over complex ones.  
Keep the codebase minimal: avoid clever or tricky one-liners in favor of clarity.  
Keep code and documentation clean: avoid duplication.

## III. Developer-Centric Documentation

All documentation **MUST** be developer-focused, with clear, concise technical explanations. Quickstart guides **MUST** enable local setup in under 5 minutes.

## IV. Change Management

When changes are made, update the version in `package.json` and revise documentation (Markdown files) to reflect them.

## V. Comprehensive Change Analysis

When implementing or fixing code, always verify correctness by analyzing related files and dependencies.
