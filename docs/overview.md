# Overview & API

This section collects the most important docs for the project: provider configuration, API compatibility notes, deployment tips, and examples.

- **Provider configuration** — Edit `provider.js` to add/remove providers or change model selections.
- **Compatibility** — The server exposes OpenAI-compatible endpoints but routes requests through multiple providers.
- **Deploy** — Use Render, Vercel, or GitHub Actions for docs. See `readme.md` for deployment examples.

For examples, testing scripts and inline usage see the `/tests` folder in the repo.
